Whitespace evaluation code
--------------------------

This code is currently a collection of the work that Kate Harrison has done on cognitive radio with the help of Mubaraq Mishra and [Anant Sahai](http://eecs.berkeley.edu/~sahai). This code has been used to generate results which were used in numerous [papers](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~harriska/CR/wiki/doku.php?id=papers) and it has accompanying [documentation](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~harriska/CR/wiki/doku.php?id=code) on a [wiki](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~harriska/CR/wiki/).

Feel free to contact Kate with any questions or comments. If you'd like to join in the development, please email Kate (harriska at eecs dot berkeley dot edu).


More data
---------
This repository has a limited amount of pre-computed data to make it easier and faster to get started. However, Kate has a large collection of pre-computed data (all of which can be computed with the source files here given enough time) that she is happy to share on an individual basis. Please contact her if you are interested.
