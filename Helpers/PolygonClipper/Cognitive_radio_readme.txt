I downloaded this file on September 29, 2011, from http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8818-polygon-clipper

I have compiled it using the instructions in ReadMe.txt (run 'mex gpc.c gpc_mexfile.c -O -output PolygonClip' in the Matlab terminal) for my Mac and the resulting files have been included. The source page claims that it will work out-of-the-box for Windows machines but I have not verified this.

Many thanks to the authors!
